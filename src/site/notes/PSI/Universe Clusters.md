Universe clusters are collections of [[PSI/Universes\|universes]] that have [[PSI/Attraction\|similar content]]. These universe clusters have a central point from which all [[PSI/Finality (Fatalism)\|subsequent]] [[PSI/Universes\|universes]] emerge. Even though they originate from that center, all of these universes are understood to exist [[PSI/Simultaneity (Eternalism)\|simultaneously]]. 

The further they are from their origin, the less [[PSI/Attraction\|similar]] they are to it. The same counts between [[PSI/Universes\|universes]]; the more similar a [[PSI/Universes\|universe]] is to another, the [[PSI/Attraction\|closer they are]]. 

Clusters don't have borders or clear edges. They are 'fuzzy'.
