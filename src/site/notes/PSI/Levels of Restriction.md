Here are the five stages of restriction:

1. Primordial
   Interpreted either as a singular entity or a collective one. It is infinite regardless. This is the purest, unbridled form of [[PSI/PSI\|PSI]]. It has limitless potential. 
   
   *What came first, the seed or the plant?*
   
2. Causative
   The cause for [[PSI/Materia\|matter]]/idea comes to be. 
   
   *Either way, a seed is sown.*
   
3. Creative
   [[PSI/Materia\|Materia]]/the idea forms. 
   
   *This seed sprouts.*
  
4. Formative
   [[PSI/Materia\|Materia]]/ the idea is shaped. 
   
   *This sprout becomes a plant.*

5. Active
   [[PSI/Materia\|Materia]]/the idea is manifested. 
   
   *This plant bares fruit, seeds and all.*


The process that an individual undergoes when realizing an idea is similar to the creation of matter. With [[PSI/Psychic Abilities\|psychic abilities]], these two are essentially the same. This is called [[PSI/Manifestation\|manifestation]].

All stages of restriction exist in tandem, and restriction is not necessarily a be-all-end-all of [[PSI/PSI\|PSI]]. Another clarification needed is that restriction doesn't purely produce [[PSI/Materia\|matter]], but also *events* and *phenomena.*
