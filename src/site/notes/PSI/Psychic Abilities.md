A psychic ability is a shortcut for [[PSI/Manifestation\|manifestation]], allowing [[PSI/PSI\|PSI]] to go through the [[PSI/Levels of Restriction\|stages of restriction]]almost instantly. The contents of the [[PSI/Manifestation\|manifestations]] befit the user's [[PSI/Simultaneity (Eternalism)\|eternal]] wishes, in respects to their past, future, and present. 

The above described abilities are called ***individual** psychic abilities*, which eventually created [[PSI/Collective Psychic Abilities\|collective psychic abilities]].
