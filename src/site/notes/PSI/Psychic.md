The most fundamental definition of a psychic is a being capable of [[PSI/Manifestation\|manifesting]]. In that sense, everyone can be a psychic. ***However,*** the sense in Tenjiki, BLOOD and Kami in Training is more complicated than this. It distinguishes between psychics and non-psychics:

*A being capable of manifesting through thought alone.*

A non-psychic thus has the ability to manifest, just like the psychic. But the psychic can realize their ideas through thinking alone; *the thought alone is the act.* This ability arose not on its own, but because [[PSI/Birushana\|Birushana]] blessed all living beings with the capacity to [[PSI/The Miracle\|live their dreams]]. This blessing, or [[PSI/The Miracle\|miracle]], created [[PSI/Psychic Abilities\|psychic abilities]].

Thus the standard definition of a psychic is:

*A being capable of using psychic powers.*
