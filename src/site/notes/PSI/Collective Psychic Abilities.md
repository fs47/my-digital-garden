The existence of [[PSI/Individual Psychic Abilities\|individual abilities]] and [[PSI/The Miracle\|the miracle]] that created them was inquired upon by [[PSI/The Eucosmos\|the Eucosmos' residents]]. The fact that shortcuts could be [[PSI/Manifestation\|manifested]] was not lost on them. They would begin attempting to [[PSI/Manifestation\|manifest]] abilities on their own.

This experiment revealed:

1. If one tried the exercise on their own, manifesting an ability was arduous and slow;
   
2. the process could go faster with more than one person;
   
3. that goes even faster with a common goal;
   
4. this goal requires a common mindset;
   
5. this common mindset [[PSI/Attraction\|forms]] a group of similar [[PSI/Individual Psychic Abilities\|individual psychic abilities]];
   
6. the resulting collective psychic ability unifies them, and 
   
7. any new [[PSI/Individual Psychic Abilities\|individual psychic ability]] that may fit in this group [[PSI/Attraction\|receives it]]. 

Points 5 through 7 can also affect [[PSI/Psychic\|non-psychics]]. This creates [[PSI/Universal Psychic Abilities\|universal psychic abilities]].
