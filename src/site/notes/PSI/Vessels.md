The physical container for a [[PSI/Souls\|soul]], made out of [[PSI/Materia\|matter]]. The one and only condition for a vessel to contain a [[PSI/Souls\|soul]] is that is similar to the [[PSI/Souls\|soul]]. If it matches it 'enough', the force of [[PSI/Attraction\|attraction]] lumps them together as one. [[PSI/Psychic\|Psychics]] describe it as being 'sucked' or 'pulled' into a you-shaped vacuum.
