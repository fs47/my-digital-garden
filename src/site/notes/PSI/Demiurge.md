The one who works for the people. A demiurge is chosen among the [[PSI/Psychic\|psychics]] of a given [[PSI/Universes\|universe]], the strongest one among them. This [[PSI/Psychic\|psychic]] would be given immortality - if they had none - and is given one task: create a new [[PSI/Universes\|universe]] after theirs [[PSI/Finality (Fatalism)\|ends]]. *The rest is up to them.*

The first demiurge was [[PSI/Birushana\|Birushana]].
