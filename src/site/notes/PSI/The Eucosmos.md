The first [[PSI/Universes\|universe]] in the [[PSI/Chrysanthemum Cluster (Kikusekai)\|Kikusekai]], created by [[PSI/Birushana\|Birushana]] its [[PSI/Demiurge\|demiurge]]. This is where all the most powerful [[PSI/Psychic\|psychics]], [[PSI/Psychic Abilities\|individual psychic abilities]], and [[PSI/Collective Psychic Abilities\|collective psychic abilities]] that exist in the [[PSI/Chrysanthemum Cluster (Kikusekai)\|Kikusekai]] originated.

It was a utopia where every living being could [[PSI/The Miracle\|live out their dreams]]. The cosmos was a breathable atmosphere, and planets were just a stone's throw away from each other. It was peaceful and joyful; nobody had anything to worry about. Every [[PSI/Demiurge\|demiurge]] after it [[PSI/Finality (Fatalism)\|ended]] wished to replicate it, but each successive one had more and more trouble doing so.
