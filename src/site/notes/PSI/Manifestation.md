The process of [[PSI/Restriction\|restriction]] pertains to both the creative process of individuals, and the creation of [[PSI/Materia\|matter]]. 

Inspiration entails one happening upon an idea. The rest comes from their commitment to the idea. The result is making something that hasn't *come into being*. 

The creation of [[PSI/Materia\|matter]] bares the same fruit; something that wasn't before *comes into being*. 

This common act is called *manifestation*. It is unlike [[PSI/Restriction\|restriction]]; it pertains to an *active* act, not a *passive* one. [[PSI/PSI\|PSI]] *undergoes* [[PSI/Restriction\|restriction]] because an [[PSI/Psychic\|entity]] manifested something.

In the [[PSI/Simultaneity (Eternalism)\|eternal]] sense, the thing manifested has *always* existed - in the future, past, or present.
