The product of [[PSI/Presence (Presentism)\|presence]] and [[PSI/Simultaneity (Eternalism)\|simultaneity]]. All things have their first and last destinations in their [[PSI/Time\|timelines]], which are fixed in [[PSI/Levels of Restriction\|the primordial stage of PSI]]. This means when a thing is [[PSI/Manifestation\|done]], it will be inevitably *undone.* It can be likened to death. For another thing to begin, another must end.
