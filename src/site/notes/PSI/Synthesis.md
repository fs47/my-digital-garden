The combination of concepts that creates a new one. This new concept 'binds' its constituents through [[PSI/Attraction\|attraction]], like a neutron to its electrons and protons. 

This happens when two or more [[PSI/Psychic Abilities\|psychic abilities]] are used at once. They essentially fuse and create something new. This is also a process that allows [[PSI/Dimensional Abilities\|dimensional]] and [[PSI/Material Abilities\|material abilities]] to fuse, creating [[PSI/Reifying Abilities\|reifying abilities]]. 

The act of synthesis requires [[PSI/Dual Processing\|dual processing]].
