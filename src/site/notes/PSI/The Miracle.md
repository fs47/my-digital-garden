The miracle that allowed for psychic powers to exist, worked by [[PSI/Birushana\|Birushana]]. 

[[PSI/Birushana\|Birushana]] felt that every living being should be able to choose the life they want and live out their dreams. With his omnipotent capacity for [[PSI/Manifestation\|manifestation]], he bestowed each and every intelligent being in his cosmos - the Eucosmos - the power to realize themselves. This would be called 'the miracle'.
