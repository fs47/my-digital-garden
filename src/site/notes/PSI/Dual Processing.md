[[PSI/Manifestation\|Manifesting]] two things separately is akin to multitasking; it is hard, if not impossible for some. Even if possible, the mental faculties are divided across both, effectively halving the speed of [[PSI/Restriction\|restriction]]. This is much easier to do with [[PSI/Psychic Abilities\|psychic abilities]], but the bar was not that high anyhow. 

The act of using two [[PSI/Psychic Abilities\|psychic abilities]] at once is called *dual processing.* 

It is akin to learning how to drive a car. At first you fumble, overwhelmed by all the buttons, the stick, steering, navigating - but after many hours of doing it, it becomes like second nature. Switching gears on the highway becomes just as natural to you as blinking. Parking? Just as hard as making your coffee. 

It is important that this isn't needed with some [[PSI/Psychic Abilities\|abilities]]. Some of them are so [[PSI/Attraction\|close]] to each other that using them both is not that hard, like eating and drinking.
