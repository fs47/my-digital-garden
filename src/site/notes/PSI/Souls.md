The non-physical representation of a physical thing or being that 'inhabits' it. 

This soul is composed of [[PSI/PSI\|PSI]] of all [[PSI/Levels of Restriction\|levels of restriction]] ***except the last and first.*** The first (primordial level) is excluded because it isn't diversified enough to be 'something'. As for the last, it is excluded because [[PSI/Materia\|matter]] isn't abstract. 

[[PSI/Attraction\|Attraction]] makes it so all these [[PSI/Levels of Restriction\|levels]] are in the same place - the [[PSI/Vessels\|vessel]]. Of course, this [[PSI/Vessels\|vessel]] has to be made out of [[PSI/Materia\|matter]]. The soul *generally* can't exist without its [[PSI/Vessels\|vessel]] and vice versa. If the vessel [[PSI/Finality (Fatalism)\|dies; meets its end]], so does the soul. There are exceptions to this rule. See [[PSI/Celestials\|celestials]].

A being's [[PSI/Psychic Abilities\|psychic ability]] is part of their soul. The act of [[PSI/Manifestation\|manifestation]] is also associated with the soul.
