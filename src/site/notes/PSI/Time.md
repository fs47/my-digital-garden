The organizing forces of [[PSI/Restriction\|restriction]] and [[PSI/Attraction\|attraction]] give order into a cloud of events, phenomena, etc..

*Restriction and attraction are an organizing force.*

[[PSI/Restriction\|Restriction]] is on its own doesn't pertain to place and moment. [[PSI/Attraction\|Attraction]] does; similar moments are closer together, and even bleed into each other. Think of it as frames in cartoons; a frame that succeeds another is similar to the last. The [[PSI/Levels of Restriction\|primordial level]] contains all of the frames, [[PSI/Restriction\|restriction]] takes all these frames and passes them on to [[PSI/Attraction\|attraction]] to compile. 

The ways these 'frames' [[PSI/Manifestation\|manifest]] are put together are called *timelines.* The progress of these timelines is called *time.* This version of time is analogous to our concept of time. 

A consequence of this is [[PSI/Presence (Presentism)\|presence]]: something needs a cause to exist, otherwise it won't. This seems to contrasts with [[PSI/Simultaneity (Eternalism)\|simultaneity]], where the future, past, and present all exist at once - *no causes needed.*

[[PSI/Presence (Presentism)\|Presence]] also introduces a *start* and an *end;* an animation has a *first* and *final* frame. For one frame to start, another has to end. 

Strangely, these endings and beginnings are also weaved into [[PSI/Levels of Restriction\|the primordial stage of PSI]]. This is called [[PSI/Finality (Fatalism)\|finality]], the fixed final state of everything.
